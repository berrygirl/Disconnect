# Disconnect
My project is a website for meditation and yoga enthusiasts, featuring an extensive collection of yoga positions enriched by the use of APIs

The mission was to help users understand the significance of disconnecting from the stresses of daily life through yoga and meditation. I have used web technologies that seamlessly combine HTML5, CSS, and animations to create a visually appealing and immersive experience.

The website features the use of semantic HTML5 elements, ensuring both accessibility and search engine optimization. To enhance the user experience, I've incorporated responsive design principles and media queries, making the site accessible across various devices and screen sizes.

Moreover, I've employed advanced web techniques such as web requests, API integration, and fetch functions to provide valuable resources and information related to yoga and meditation. This not only enriches the content but also allows users to access real-time data and updates.

To deliver an interactive experience, I've harnessed the power of DOM manipulation, enabling dynamic content updates and seamless navigation. Additionally, I've utilized CSS pseudo-classes and elements for precise styling and interactivity.

This website serves as a serene digital oasis, guiding users toward tranquility and mindfulness after a demanding day of work. It is not just a website; it is a digital sanctuary designed to help individuals find balance and inner peace amidst the chaos of modern life
